# Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to the Python Data Structures. Every program you write will use data structures in some way.  Data structures are used to organize and store data in a way that makes it easy to access and manipulate.  In this tutorial, you will learn about the most common data structures and how to use them in Python.

- [Queues](1-queue.md)
- [Sets](2-set.md)
- [Trees](3-tree.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples.  At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own.  You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
