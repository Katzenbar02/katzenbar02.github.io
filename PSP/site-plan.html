        A piano is an incredible instrument and millions of people learn piano in their lifetime.
         It is an instrument of love and passion and all kinds of emotions. When starting out piano it is best to start out young so that in the future it is easier to pick up and to know how a piano works.
          Learning piano and practicing its technique is much like learning a language. Much practice is needed but not only that, but a love for learning and love of music and the joy and emotions it can bring.
           Children are in need of a purpose and giving them a purpose brings so much joy into them and creates a marvelous young person in the future.
            Learning piano teaches discipline and hard work.

      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        I offer piano lessons to children from 1st grade to 8th grade. During this time of a childâ€™s life, they are in dire need of finding a place to excel and be the best they can be.
         I am an outlet to those children that need a way to express themselves and find value in themselves when they may not seem very confident.
          Lessons in piano teach so many valuable lessons besides piano. Man children lack confidence in their abilities when they are young, but they need to know that they have an infinite potential to them that needs to be savaged and not wasted.
         By your child taking my piano lessons, they will show a great boost in confidence.

        Here you can schedule an appointment for your child to take piano lessons. Follow along on the sign-up page, put all your information in, and make an appointment.
         My schedule follows along the school day so your child can take piano lessons after school when they are free. If your child is homeschooled I can make an exception during the day so your child can still learn and practice piano.
          Make sure to schedule an appointment at least a week before our meeting or else there may not be enough time to get an appropriate scheduled time that you and your child would want.
           If you and your child want a scheduled appointment each week at a specific time, email me or talk with me before our appointment so we can discuss a weekly.

        My piano lessons are very accommodating and I have had several years of piano lessons. I was self-taught and have taught and helped other students learn and perform with the piano.
         Since I have had many trials and errors with being self-taught and have taught other people, I know many things about teaching and have had experience with teaching many different styles of teaching.
