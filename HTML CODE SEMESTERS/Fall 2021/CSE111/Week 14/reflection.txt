Please take a few minutes to reflect on your experience in CSE 111 and
think about the challenges, successes, and all that you've learned
along the way.


Now, please respond thoroughly (1 - 2 paragraphs for each question) to
the following questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
    I saw the power of functions when I discovered how to use neseted funtions and paramteters and arguments. 
    Nested funtions are incredible to have the values and variables in one function transfer to another function or several.
    During my last assignment I had several nested functions inside one function and I was able to use the variables inside the funtion with the nested funtions.

    On the same note of nested functions, using parameters and arguments it is possible to call variables from one function and use those variables in as arguments.
    
2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
    Test functions are usful to test obscure values. There is use in test funtions; however, I do feel that if you manually fix code there is no need to have test funtctions.
    Test functions are especially useful for when there are plenty of functions that need to be tested.
     Its challenging to make sure every piece of code is working no matter what.



3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
    I troubleshoot by experimenting with the code until something works.
     It is very time consuming but I feel I learn so much and gain so much experience by practicing and experimenting.
     I can more effectivly improve my process by looking up online how to fix my problem when there is an error.
